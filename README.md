<!--- ORGANISER THINGS TO CONSIDER 
- Which technical competencies, behaviours and knowledge module topics does the bootcamp cover/meet
- Structuring retros so that they can inform thinking for individual's personal learning records (off the job training record tab in their learning logs)
- Introducing some sort of test or quiz on basic concept learning points from the bootcamp to validate that they have taken stuff in, and provide organisation mentors with results to help them focus follow ups
--->

## Competencies, Behaviours and Knowledge units

These relate to the KSBs defined in the [Level 4 Software Developer standard](https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/apprenticeship-standards/software-developer-v1-1).

* **S1**: create logical and maintainable code
* **S4**: test code and analyse results to correct errors found using unit testing
* **S12**: follow software designs and functional or technical specifications
* **S10**: build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment
* **S14**: follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control
* **S14**: follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control

## Resources 

* Slides
* Laptops
* Internet access
* Post-its
* Pens
* Whiteboard

## Mentors / Languages
 
Two–three mentors required in addition to leads. These should be able to cover support for the required languages.

Exercises (katas and code starters) will need to be ported to required languages.

Mentors should be comfortable with branching, feature toggles, setting up Travis for their chosen language.

## Prep-work for apprentices

* Make sure you can sign in to github.com with your own account by signing out and signing in again
* Open [the template repo](https://github.com/MCR-Digital/apprentice-boot-camp-fundamentals-3/) and click ‘Use this template’
* Clone your repo: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/apprentice-boot-camp-fundamentals-3.git`
* Follow the instructions in the README for your language under the `exercises` directory, **making sure you can run the tests** (which are all ignored)
  * [Java](exercises/java/README.md)
  * [Kotlin](exercises/kotlin)
  * [JavaScript](exercises/javascript/README.md)
  * [Typescript](exercises/typescript/README.md)
  * [C#](exercises/dotnet/README.md)
  * [PHP](exercises/php/README.md)
* It’s normal to have problems with this, so just let us know! :)

### Follow-on tasks

Organisation mentors should look to exercise the knowledge we’ve covered in the boot camp. Below are suggestions for tasks that would do this, but please use your own judgement to work out what to do. There is no need for anything to be returned to MD or the presenters—it’s just a learning exercise.

* Find out what CI systems the organisation uses
* Find out how the team works with branches and discuss this with your mentor
* Find out how the team deploys code and manages releases to mitigate risk

# Briefing for organisation mentors

* Review the summary above
* Have a go at the exercises to get a gist for the
    * Exercises are described in the slides linked to at the top of the repo
    * Code for the exercises is in the `exercises` directory
* On the day get involved when they are doing the exercises and help them when they get stuck
* Ask them open questions about what they are doing
  * Ask to see what they’ve done
  * Start with the tests
* Help resolve language specific issues
* Coach them towards finding their own solutions rather than fixing things for them

# Git kata exercises

The git exercises are included as a git subtree from https://github.com/eficode-academy/git-katas.git. **It is best not to update them** unless you are familiar with maintaining changes to subtrees. To fetch changes from the origin, run `git subtree pull --prefix exercises/git https://github.com/eficode-academy/git-katas.git master --squash`.
